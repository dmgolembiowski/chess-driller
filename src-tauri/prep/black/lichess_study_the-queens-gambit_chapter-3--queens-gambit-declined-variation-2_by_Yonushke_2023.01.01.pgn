1. d4 { [%csl Rd4] } 1... d5 2. c4 { In the previous chapter we already saw what happens if black declines the queen's gambit with e6, but there is another way for black to decline the gambit, which is c6. } 2... c6 { This is known as the Slav Defense, and is very interesting. You will also be able to see some variations with the Slav in future chapters as BLACK. Going back to our position, white can take on d5, or can develop more pieces with moves like nf3 or nc3. } 3. Nf3 (3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Bf4 Nf6 5. Nc3 { The position is completely equal. }) 3... Nf6 { If black takes, white anyway plays e4. } (3... dxc4 { e3 is an alternative } 4. e4 { [%csl Gc4,Re4,Rd4][%cal Gf1c4] } (4. e3 { [%csl Rc4][%cal Gf1c4] } 4... b5 5. a4 e6 6. b3 { Slightly complicated, but is slightly better for white. } { [%csl Rb5,Rc4,Rd4][%cal Rb3c4,Ra4b5,Rf1c4,Rf3e5,Rd4e5,Rd4c5] })) 4. e3! { white continues, to develop, and e3 is very nice because it makes way for the light squared bishop to defend the c4 pawn. } (4. cxd5 cxd5 { Also fine. }) 4... Bf5 (4... dxc4?! { If black takes, it is only helping white, to develop. } 5. Bxc4 { +0.8 for white. }) 5. Nc3 { The game is pretty much equal and white has a nice position and perhaps a little more development. } { [%csl Rc4,Rd4] } *
